            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Our pillars of Society, Brotherhood, and Remembrance were established upon the formation of the Alpha Chapter at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, on August 16, 1996. Our founders realized the unique promise of a Greek-lettered
                organization that instills positive values among its members, provides an avenue for leadership, and promotes self-betterment. In its nascent stages, these founders understood that they must maintain a constant and growing nationwide network
                in order to truly manifest their organizational vision. As such, several new brothers were inducted on August 22, 1998 in New York. At this time, eight men from three different universities were given the status of National Founding Fathers
                as they were the visionaries who established the Fraternity for years to come. Modern day Sigma Beta Rho has grown considerably since its inception. We have expanded from our roots on the East Coast to forty five recognized active chapters
                and colonies that span the breadth of the nation. This growth stems from a reputation for excellent, values-based programming, diversity among our brotherhood, and alignment with the ideals of many students who strive for a competitive
                edge before entering a post-globalized working world. As an organization that prides itself on having individuals from every continent, ethnicity, and religion, we seek to foster enriching, cross-cultural discourse both amongst our members
                and within our campus communities. Through the efforts of our brothers, we have become the largest, most expansive fraternity of our kind in seventeen years. With each passing day, we strive to take one more step towards realizing the
                nationwide network envisioned by our National Founding Fathers.</p>
